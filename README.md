Task 2- Portfolio

OIBSIP EXPERIENCE My internship journey with OASIS INFOBYTE I am Poonam Gaikwad. In this blog I will be sharing my journey as an intern at Oasis Infobyte through their internship program. This program was for one month and was very effective and worth it. During this internship we were given 3 levels and we had to complete any 1 out of the 3 levels. I have completed 1 level as per the instructions.I would highly recommend this internship to everyone who wants to gain hands-on knowledge to their skills. At last I would like to thank Oasis Infobyte for giving me this opportunity to develop my skills. Here is the link to apply: https://oasisinfobyte.com/
